# ADR-009: Every module carries a card and a README, and scripts keep both honest

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-24
**Approved by:** Commander. The ruling:
- Every module, at every level of sub-module, has an `AGENTS.md` and a `README.md` that agents read before working on it, and both are updated whenever code in that module or its sub-modules changes.
- Tests fail loudly when they are not updated, so a worker who changes code sees the docs test fail and goes back to read the files again.

## Context
A module card (`AGENTS.md`) is the fence a worker is measured against. Nothing checked that the card still matched the registry or the code. Nothing gave humans and agents a plain explanation of what a module actually does. And nothing noticed when code moved on and its docs didn't.

## Decision
`tools/doc_check.py` enforces four rules, and each has a planted-fault test:
1. **Present.** Every module, at every level, has `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.
2. **Card matches the registry and the code.** Card and registry list the same public names and the same `depends_on`. In a code module, `public` is every public function and class and nothing else; `main` is exempt. An interface change without a card change fails.
3. **Parent README names each sub-module**, by registry name.
4. **Docs current.** Compared against the base commit (the merge-base with main, or `$SOP_BASE`), counting uncommitted and untracked files: a module whose code changed must also have changed its README.
   - The owning module is the deepest one, so a sub-module's change needs its own README.
   - A `README waiver: <module>: <why>` line in a work order changed in the same diff excuses it, for the IT manager to accept.

Rules 1 to 3 run inside `sop_check.py`. Rule 4 runs as a contract test (`tests/contract/test_module_docs_current.py`), so whoever runs the tests sees it fail before handing off, and the message says what to reread.

A module registered before READMEs were required can be marked `docs_pending = true`; rules 1 to 4 skip it until a work order converts it.

## Reasons
- A card is only a fence if it's true, and "keep the docs updated" written as a rule gets ignored; a failing test doesn't.
- Rule 2 is a content check, not a touch check. Forcing a card edit on every code change would produce junk edits, since most changes don't change a module's rules.
- The README is a touch check with a waiver. A check can prove a file changed; whether the prose is right stays the IT manager's review.

## Consequences
- Helpers that aren't part of a module's interface are named private (leading underscore).
- Every commit that changes a module's code also touches its README, or carries a waiver.
- Mutation evidence (2026-09-24): 11 of 11 mutants of `doc_check.py` were killed, each by its guard test. The unchanged control and a comment-only edit both passed.
